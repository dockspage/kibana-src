# kibana-src

The Source Code For The Kibana Snapshot Build Downloaded By Script From GitHub.

It will be used to test how Alamode can compile Node.js modules on a big production code base.

The source is added from an OSS snapshot build (https://snapshots.elastic.co/downloads/kibana/kibana-oss-6.5.0-SNAPSHOT-darwin-x86_64.tar.gz).

There are also TypeScript files which will be transpiled separately.
